For the movement of the hand and fingers are 6 small servomotors were used (1 for the wrist, 5 for the fingers) with torque 1,6kg/cm. The inner rib in Nayoln, which can be noted in the picture on the right, allows the 5 servomotors to pull or push individual fingers, thus making an opening or closing.

The movement of the elbow and shoulder is made possible by 2 other servomotors, this time with a torque of 20 kg/cm.
